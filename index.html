        <h2>Running with Proper Form</h2>

        <p class="para">Runners spend a lot of time doing complex training routines, workouts, and such, 
            However, many fail to grasp one of the more simple aspects of running: form. Good (or bad) form
            can make or break a tight race, and can seriously affect energy levels. The idea is to run in a manner
            that conserves the most energy. This involves not wasting energy in pointless ways. For example, people have a 
            tendency to clench their fists while running, which is a useless waste of energy. A good way to measure this is to run
            while holding something fragile, like a potato chip. If you break the chip in your hands while running, you are 
            clenching your fists too hard. Additionally, people should try not run on the front of their feet (unless they are full sprinting),
            as it creates more pressure than needed on the that part of the foot, which could lead to an injury called a shin splint. It is better
            to land on the back part of the foot, and then roll towards the front of the foot as you run, which evenly spreads the pressure of the impact.
            Another tip is when running, make sure to not move your arms side to side perpendicular to yourself. Always move your arms in the same direction
            that you are moving, as moving them any other way will only obstruct your momentum.

        <h2>Balancing Water Intake Before Running</h2>

            It's pretty obvious that staying hyrdrated is important to success while being a running. This is true for both normal runs and races. However, 
            proper hydration is a skill that is easy to get wrong, as it is possible to hydrate incorrectly. I'm here to help you avoid that. First and formost,
            the key is spreading out your hydration. It is easy to forget to drink water, and decide to chug a bunch down shortly before you run. This is bad, and will
            only lead to cramps, which can be extremely painful. Also, it doesn't allow your body time to take in all that water so fast. The key is to spread
            out your water intake throughout the day, drinking small sips frequently, and not drinking any water (save for maybe a coupple tiny sips) for about an 
            hour before you run. This will allow your body enough time to properly absorb the water without overloading it. Basically, if you have to use the bathroom a lot
            throughout the day, that is a very good sign you are hydrating enough. Hydration is also more than a one day process, especially before a big race, you will
            want to keep properly hydrated for days before the race in order to get the maximum effect. Also remember, while they are not all that bad, electrolyle drinks
            such as Gatorade are not subsitutes for water and should not be used as such. Yes, they are good for replenishing lost electrolytes after exercise but they will
            not work in the same way water does.
