            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome. My name is Baxter, and this blog serves the purpose of me relaying some tips and tricks about running from an amateur perspective
            I was a cross country and track runner for 4 years in high school, and a runner for leisure afterwards. I learned a lot about running during that time,
            and I would like to share some things I learned over the years. At the moment, I am a 19 year old college student studying game development with the hopes
            of working in the games industry someday. I am from Michigan, United States, and I have lived However 
            my whole life, save for a 6 month period where I lived in Arizona about 10 years ago. I love sushi, frogs, and computers. <br>My personal hobbies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Running</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope while reading this blog, you can get a taste of one of my hobbies. Running, both competitively and casually, 
                is something I have spent quite a bit of time on in my life so far so I feel very connected to the sport, and greatly enjoy
                discussing it. <br>On a final note, here is a picture of myself from 2020! Please enjoy your stay here.
